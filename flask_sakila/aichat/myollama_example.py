'''
Installation:
In your virtual environment:
pip install ollama
and then go to https://ollama.com/download, download for Windows
Run the OllamaSetup.exe
Once the installation is complete, run ollama in the pop-up window that'll appear in the bottom-right of your screen:
A powershell starts, which suggest you to run:
ollama run llama3.2
which you should run, and after the model is downloaded, a prompt will appear.
Type hi, and it will ask you how to help you. That means that the installation is successful.

For the assignment, create a new file, e.g. name it myollama.py, to implement the methods that you are going to need. Careful not to name the file ollama.py.
